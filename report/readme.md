1. Introduction

This report summarizes the security audit activities carried out to assess the security posture of the system. The objective was to identify potential vulnerabilities, evaluate configurations, and provide recommendations for improvement.

2. Scope of Audit

The audit focused on the following areas:

* System access and authentication
* Network configuration and services
* Patch management and updates
* File and data security
* Backup and recovery mechanisms
* General security policies and practices



 3. Activities Performed

During the audit, the following tasks were performed:

1. **System Review** – Checked installed applications, running services, and configurations.
2. **User and Access Management** – Verified user accounts, roles, and password policies.
3. **Update & Patch Verification** – Reviewed whether the system was up to date with security patches.
4. **Log Analysis** – Examined system and security logs for unusual activity.
5. **Backup Review** – Ensured backup mechanisms were in place and functioning.
6. **Network Security Check** – Tested firewall settings and unnecessary open ports.
7. **Malware & Vulnerability Scan** – Performed a basic scan to detect known vulnerabilities.


 4. Findings

* Accounts with weak or no password policies were identified.
* Some unnecessary services were enabled, which could increase the attack surface.
* Patches and updates were not applied regularly on certain applications.
* Backups were present but not tested for recovery.
* Logging mechanisms existed but required more detailed monitoring.


 5. Recommendations

* Enforce strong password and authentication policies.
* Disable or remove unnecessary services.
* Apply regular security patches and updates.
* Test backup restoration procedures to ensure data recovery.
* Implement continuous monitoring for system logs.
* Establish a periodic security audit schedule.

 6. Conclusion
The security audit provided insight into the current security posture of the system. While the system had basic protections in place, several areas required improvement. By implementing the recommendations, the organization can strengthen its overall security, reduce risks, and ensure better protection of information assets.
